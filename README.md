# Comparative Evaluation of GA, ACO, and RL for Cloud-Aware Task Scheduling in Smart Home and IoT Environments

## üìÑ Abstract

This repository provides the source code, datasets (if available), and documentation for the comparative study of **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**, **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**, and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques in cloud-aware task scheduling. The project evaluates these algorithms under identical IoT task loads and compares their effectiveness in terms of **energy efficiency**, **task completion (QoS)**, and **computational overhead**.

## üß† Objective

To experimentally analyze and compare GA, ACO, and RL in smart environments enabled by cloud computing, focusing on:

* Reducing energy consumption
* Improving Quality of Service (QoS)
* Managing computational cost

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

```
IoT Devices --> Task Scheduler (GA/ACO/RL) --> Cloud Resources
                                  |
                               Performance Metrics
```

Each algorithm schedules tasks on cloud infrastructure with varying priorities, deadlines, and energy budgets.

## üìä Results Summary

| Algorithm | Energy Efficiency (%) | QoS (Task Completion %) | Overhead (ms/task) |
| --------- | --------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------ |
| GA        | 68.5                  | 84.2                    | 14.3               |
| ACO       | 72.1                  | 79.8                    | 18.7               |
| RL        | 70.4                  | 88.5                    | 23.9               |

## üìà Key Insights

* **GA** is fast and low on overhead but lacks adaptability.
* **ACO** provides the best energy savings for low task volumes.
* **RL** achieves the highest QoS but with high computational cost.
* Cloud computing amplifies the benefits of all three by offering scalability and offloading computation.
